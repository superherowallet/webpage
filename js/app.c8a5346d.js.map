send your tips to your AE wallet address in a crypto exchange\n                      that supports AE tokens (see list above).\n                      <ul>\n                        <li>Go to the hamburger menu, click Withdraw.</li>\n                        <li>Enter your wallet address from the crypto exchange of your choice as\n                        well as the amount you want to withdraw.</li>\n                        <li>Review the transaction details and hit Send once you are satisfied.</li>\n                      </ul>\n                    </p>\n                    <p>\n                      These can then be converted into other cryptocurrencies,\n                      or converted into fiat and subsequently transferred to your local bank.\n                      Methods for these vary per country.\n                      Hopefully, in the future,\n                      you will be able to cash out directly from AE into your bank.\n                      Or even better, you may not even need to cash out at all in a world\n                      where all merchants around you accept AE tokens. ;)\n                    </p>`\"\n        />\n      </div>\n
