Personal data collection The personal data Superhero.com collects is minimized completely, selecting only those types of information, which are adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary for the use of the Website. Superhero.com collects two main groups of personal data according to their purpose: 3.1. Personal data in relation to indirect identifiers The donations and comments are conducted via the Extension Superherowallet. The Superhero wallet is a blockchain based application on which an account address is generated for user identification. Once the donation and comment are processed, they appear on the Website with a hyperlink forwarding to the website the User has tipped. Furthermore, other Users on the Website can additionally donate and comment on news added to the Website. Therefore, the account address will appear on the Website. The account addresses can be treated as indirect identifiers. An indirect identifier is a value which cannot be used alone to identify a data subject, however, could be identifying if combined with other indirect identifiers. The processing is necessary for the purpose of provision of the Service- namely the Website. The retention period for the personal data is until termination of the Service provision. 3.2. Personal data in relation to User support and communication During the use of our Website, users may decide to contact the team in relation to website support, troubleshoot problems, questions, etc. The collection of the personal data is initiated by Users and they decide what type of personal data to include in the communication.

Remember where you saved these files.\n          </p>\n\n          <p>\n            For Chrome:\n            On the upper right of your web browser, find the ellipsis menu.\n\n            Go to More Tools > Extensions.\n            Make sure Developer Mode is turned on. Then click Load Unpacked.\n\n            Choose the unzipped folder for the Suerhero wallet—do not choose any file,\n            just the folder itself.\n          </p>\n\n          <p>\n            That’s it. The Superhero icon should appear on the upper right of your browser toolbar.\n          </p>\n\n          <p>\n            For Firefox:\n            On the upper right of your web browser, find the hamburger menu.\n\n            Choose Add-ons.\n\n            Creating your wallet.\n            <ul>\n              <li>\n                Tick the checkbox to agree to the terms and conditions.\n

           You can now start receiving tips from anyone through your wallet address.\n          </p>\n\n          <p>\n            You can find your wallet address on your dashboard, right above your balance.\n            It’s a random string of numbers and letters that starts with ak_.\n          </p>\n\n          <p>\n            You can easily copy this by clicking the copy button  right next to your wallet address.\n          </p>\n\n          <p>\n            Backing up your seed phrase\n          </p>\n\n          <p>\n            With great freedom comes great responsibility.\n            In this case, a little responsibility:\n            you are in charge of keeping the keys to your account,\n            and making sure you can retrieve it when necessary.\n          </p>\n\n          <p>\n            Security in the free web is a little different from what most people are used to.\n            It’s much better—yet not really difficult.\n            Because there are no third party custodians to keep and connect passwords with accounts,\n            this task is yours, Superhero.\n          </p>\n\n          <p>\n            Once you’re in your dashboard,\n            it is highly recommended that you back up your seed phrase.\n            The seed phrase is somewhat like a password.\n            You will need this seed phrase to retrieve your wallet in case you\n            lose access to the extension for any reason\n            (migrating to a new device, reinstalling browser, etc.).\n          </p>\n\n          <p>\n            Here’s how to do it:\n\n            <ul>\n              <li>\n                Click the hamburger menu on the upper right of your wallet.\n              </li>\n              <li>\n                Go to Settings, choose Seed Phrase.\n              </li>\n              <li>\n                On the next screen, click Show seed phrase.\n              </li>\n              <li>\n                Write down the 12 words displayed on a

    Sending tips\n\n            <ul>\n              <li>\n                To send someone tips, make sure you are on the URL that you want to tip.\n                The Superhero wallet will automatically detect the URL on your active tab.\n              </li>\n              <li>\n                Open your Superhero wallet extension.\n                The button should be in the upper

required fields.\n                Enter the amount of tips you want to send,\n                and add a message telling the receiver why they’re awesome.\n              </li>\n              <li>\n                Click Send tip.\n              </li>\n              <li>\n                On the next screen, review the details of your tip.\n              </li>\n              <li>\n                Click Confirm to complete the transaction.\n              </li>\n            </ul>\n          </p>\n\n          <p>\n            Collecting your tips\n\n            <ul>\n              <li>\n                To be able to receive tips,\n                you must first copy your wallet address and paste\n                it onto your web page or profile—it could be a blog,\n                a social media account, or any other online profile.\n              </li>\n              <li>\n                Save this change and refresh the page.\n                Check to see if your wallet address is publicly visible on your web page.\n              </li>\n              <li>\n                Once your wallet address is publicly displayed on your web profile,\n                all you have to do is open your Superhero wallet\n                and voila—your tips will be collected and added to your wallet balance.\n              </li>\n            </ul>\n          </p>\n\n          <p>\n            In some cases, there may be slight delays in collecting tips.\n            Give it a few minutes and try opening your wallet again.\n            If the problem persists, you may ask questions through superherowallet@protonmail.com\n          </p>\n\n          <p>\n            Loading up your wallet\n          </p>\n\n          <p>\n            To load up your Superhero wallet,\n            you can purchase AE tokens instantly using your credit card through Changelly.\n            Just copy your Superhero wallet address\n            and paste it as the recipient address for your purchase.See below.\n          </p>\n\n          <p>\n            You can also trade ETH or BTC to AE through Jelly Swap.\n          </p>\n\n          <p>\n            Additionally, here is a list of global

wallet address in a crypto exchange\n            that supports AE tokens (see list above).\n            These can then be converted into other cryptocurrencies,\n            or converted into fiat and subsequently transferred to your local bank.\n            Methods for these vary per country.\n          </p>\n\n          <p>\n            Hopefully, in the future,\n            you will be able to cash out directly from AE into your bank.\n            Or even better, you may not even need to cash out at all in a world\n            where all merchants around you accept AE tokens. ;)\n
